# How to know if your data is messy?
# We're going to look at a few columns here. I know already that there are some problems with the zip code, so let's look at that first.

# To get a sense for whether a column has problems, I usually use `.unique()` to look at all its values. If it's a numeric column, I'll instead plot a histogram to get a sense of the distribution.

# When we look at the unique values in "Incident Zip", it quickly becomes clear that this is a mess.

# Some of the problems:

# * Some have been parsed as strings, and some as floats
# * There are `nan`s
# * Some of the zip codes are `29616-0759` or `83`
# * There are some N/A values that pandas didn't recognize, like 'N/A' and 'NO CLUE'

# What we can do:

# * Normalize 'N/A' and 'NO CLUE' into regular nan values
# * Look at what's up with the 83, and decide what to do
# * Make everything strings

# Fixing the nan values and string/float confusion
# We can pass a `na_values` option to `pd.read_csv` to clean this up a little bit. We can also specify that the type of Incident Zip is a string, not a float.
